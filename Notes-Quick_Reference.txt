digitalWrite( [pin], [HIGH/LOW] ); // any pin (digital or analog)
analogWrite( [pin], [0-255] ); // PWM only supported on specific pins
digitalRead( [pin] ); // returns HIGH/LOW, any pin (digital or analog)
analogRead( [pin] ); // returns 0-1024, only on analog pins (A0 - A7)

delay( [time in milliseconds] ); // halts the sketch for a prescribed length of time. 1 second = 1000 milliseconds
delayMicroseconds( [time in microseconds] ); // as above but different units, 1 millisecond = 1000 microseconds
millis() // returns the number of milliseconds since the Arduino was reset, type Long

example:
  for (int i=0; i<8; i=i+1)
  {
    Serial.print(i);
  }
would return: 01234567

math operators such as +-*/ are obvious 
Though be careful about dividing integers you'll likely get the result rounded down to the nearest integer.
% Modulo returns the remainder from a division:
11%3 returns 2 as 11/3 = 3 2/3
3%3 returns 0
